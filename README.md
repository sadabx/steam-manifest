## What is TOST?

TOST is a modern, cross-platform floating desktop companion for Steam. It simplifies the installation and management of game manifests, Lua plugins, and Steam backend tools. 

On **Windows**, TOST seamlessly manages [OpenSteamTool](https://github.com/OpenSteam001/OpenSteamTool). 
On **Linux**, it manages [SLSsteam](https://github.com/AceSLS/SLSsteam). 

Instead of manually digging through Steam folders to paste `.manifest` and `.lua` files, TOST lets you drag and drop them right onto its floating icon. It handles all the file routing, backups, and configurations for you automatically.

## Features

### Core Management
- **Floating Desktop Icon**: A sleek, unobtrusive floating widget that sits on your screen for quick drag-and-drop installations.
- **One-Click Tool Installation**: Automatically download, install, or repair OpenSteamTool (Windows) or SLSsteam (Linux) with a single click.
- **Drag-and-Drop Installation**: Drop local `.zip`, `.lua`, or `.manifest` packages onto TOST, and it will route everything to the correct Steam directories.
- **Built-in Game Manager**: Easily view, remove, or restore managed games and their associated files without breaking your Steam installation.

### Safety and Compatibility
- **Safe Operations**: TOST automatically backs up existing files before replacing them and refuses to execute unverified Lua scripts.
- **Linux Support (Experimental)**: Support for both standard Steam and Flatpak Steam on Linux. *(Development is currently paused)*

## Getting Started

### Installation
Head over to the [TOST Releases Page](https://github.com/sadabx/TOST/releases) and download the latest version for your operating system.

- **Windows Users**: Download `*-Setup.exe` for a standard installation (recommended), or `*-Portable.zip` if you prefer a standalone directory.
- **Linux Users**: Download the `.AppImage`, `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), or the portable `.tar.gz`. Arch users can install via AUR using `yay -S tost-bin` (or your preferred AUR helper).

> [!WARNING]
> **Linux Development Paused**: Linux support is currently experimental and development is paused. Currently, TOST on Linux manages backend configurations and adds games to your Steam library via SLSsteam, but **it cannot automatically download game files**. You will need a third-party tool (like Accela) to download the game files after importing them with TOST.

### Basic Usage
1. Launch TOST. A floating "T" icon will appear on your screen.
2. Right-click the icon to open the main menu.
3. Select **Install / Repair OpenSteamTool** (Windows) or **Install / Repair SLSsteam** (Linux) to initialize the backend engine.
4. Drag and drop game packages (ZIPs, manifests, lua files) directly onto the floating icon to install them into Steam.
5. Open the **Manage Games** menu to review installed modifications or to safely remove them.

## Building from Source

TOST is built with C# and [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) for a shared, native cross-platform experience.

### Project Structure
- `Core/` - Shared business logic, Steam detection, and file routing.
- `Desktop/` - The modern Avalonia UI (Windows & Linux).
- `CLI/` - Linux terminal interface.
- `Tests/` - Automated unit test suite.
- `Legacy/` - The old, retired WinForms reference application.

### Requirements
- .NET 8.0 SDK

### Quick Build
**Run the Desktop App:**
```bash
dotnet run --project Desktop/TOST.Desktop.csproj
```

**Run the CLI (Linux):**
```bash
dotnet run --project CLI/Linux/TOST.Linux.csproj -- help
```

### Linux Architecture Details
Linux support (CLI and Desktop) natively supports Steam and Flatpak Steam. TOST safely parses Lua declarations without executing them, translates App IDs and overrides into `config.yaml`, and registers depot keys in `config.vdf`. It also generates guarded native Steam wrappers or per-user Flatpak environment overrides (`configure-launch`).
